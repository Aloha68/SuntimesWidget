**Bug Reports**

You can report bugs using the issue tracker. Be aware that times are approximate and may differ from official sources (up to 10 minutes).

When submitting a bug please be detailed and specific. What did you expect the app to do, what did you actually observe? Bugs that can't be reproduced won't get fixed. If reporting inaccurate times include the lat/lon, timezone, and the date. Other useful information includes Android OS version and your specific device model.

Any money given will indirectly go towards software development. It is not technically a donation since I am obligated to report anything given to me as earned income (and I will probably apply it toward personal expenses). I want to express my thanks to those who have sent me something. In total it has amounted to lunch and a coffee but its a very meaningful gesture.
